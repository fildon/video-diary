# Video Diary

A gallery of short-form daily videos.

Hosted on [rupertmckay.com/video-diary](https://rupertmckay.com/video-diary)

## My Workflow

I use [One Second Diary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kylekun.one_second_diary&pcampaignid=web_share) to make the videos.

At the end of each month I upload the full video to Youtube, where I keep it as an _unlisted_ video. From there I get the embeddable iframe from the share video modal.

Aside from managing the video files, only a small HTML update is needed with each upload to present the video in the webpage.

There is no build process nor dependencies necessary in this repository. The HTML is served as-is by GitHub pages.
